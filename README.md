Bias, Fairness and Explainability in Machine Learning :
This project studies if machine learning models treat different groups fairly and how such fairness is explained.




--> Initial Bias Observation:

An expolatory analysis of adult income dataset reveals significt outcome disparities across sensitive attribute "sex"

Approximately 30.5% male earn more than 50k while only 11% of female do so.This disparity exists prior to model training and highlights importance of careful fairness evolution in downstream machine learning models.
